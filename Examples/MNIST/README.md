# MNIST Exmaples

Some Keras examples over the MNIST dataset

## Example 1

Basic MNIST example with a NN with fully conected two layers. This first example show a very basic NN with two hidden layers. No regularization or normalization is performed.

Jupyter Book: [here](1_mlp_basic.ipynb)

## Example 2

The same configuration than exercises 1 badding Batch Normalization.

Python code: [here](2_mlp_batchnorm.py)

## Example 3

The same configuration than exercises 2 adding a gaussian noise regularizer.

Python code: [here](3_mlp_BN_GN.py)

## Example 4

The same configuration than exercises 3 adding learning rate annealing (learning rate scheduler).
