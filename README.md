# Deep Learning Lab
Some of the lab examples and exercises of my deep learning lectures. 

## Examples

In the [Examples](Examples/) section there are some examples for the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and
[CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) , 
divided into two sections according to the framework used: [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) or 
[Keras](https://keras.io/).

+ [Keras](Examples/Keras)
  - [MNIST](Examples/Keras/MNIST)
  - [CIFAR10](Examples/Keras/CIFAR)

+ [Pytorch](Examples/Pytorch)
  - [MNIST](Examples/Pytorch/MNIST)
  - [CIFAR10](Examples/Pytorch/CIFAR)

## Exercises

In the [Exercises](Exercises/) section there are some proposed exercises for the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

## Recommendations

Use [Googe Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run the experiments in virtual machines equiped with K80 GPUs just in case you don't have a GPU computer to run them.
